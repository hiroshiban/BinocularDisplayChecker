Generates a wallpaper that can be used for checking/adjusting locations binocular(dual) displays
function GenerateBinocularWallpaper(ress,:bgcolor)
(: is optional)

This function generates a special wallpaper using the images stored in ~/BinocularDisplayChecker/pngs.
In binocular stimulus (e.g. stereograms, or binocular rivalry) presentation, we may present left and right
eye images onto two displays separately (and we may also use an additional display for a console).
In such a situation, a strict positional adjustment of the two displays will be necessary for accurate
binocular fusion and precise measurements. The wallpaper(s) generated by this function can support these
adjustment by presenting guidelines on the screen.

[example]
>> GenerateBinocularWallpaper([1920,1200;1920,1080;1920,1080],[127,127,127]);
>> GenerateBinocularWallpaper([0,0;1920,1080;1920,1080],[127,127,127]);

[input]
ress: display resolutions, a 3 x 2 matrix.
      [width_display_1, height_display_1; width_display_2, height_display_2; width_display_3, height_display_3]
      here, display 1 is for a console, display 2 is for presenting left-eye image, and display 2 is for
      presenting right-eye image.
      e.g. ress=[1920,1200; 1920, 1080; 1920, 1080].
      currently, available resolutions are pairs of
      [1024, 768], [1280,1024], [1920,1080], [1920,1200], and [2560, 1440] (width,height).
      NOTE: if you don't use the console display (display 1) or the right-eye-image (display 3),
      please set 0 to ress of these displays. e.g. ress=[0,0; 1920, 1080; 1920, 1080].
bgcolor : (optional) background to be used on the console display (display 1)
          bgcolor=[127,127,127] by default.

[output]
no output variable, the generated wallpaper image is saved in the current directory as
wallpaper_[1|2|2]_display*.png
